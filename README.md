# Who Would Win?
A cross-universe combat simulator for fans of Pokémon and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

## Description
This combat simulator answers the question of who would win in a fight between a randomly selected Pokémon and a randomly generated Dungeons &amp; Dragons character.

At this time, one offensive (damage-dealing) attack is selected for each combatant. Generation one Pokémon and the original nine standard races and thirteen standard classes are eligible to be selected for Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters. Future releases may accomodate a broader range of combatants.

At this time, both combatants will also be assigned stats for hit points (HP), speed, attack name, and attack power. Dungeons &amp; Dragons characters will also be assigned stats for character level, which, in conjunction with the class they are assigned, determines the number of hit points they receive.

## Getting Started
On page load, two combatants will automatically be generated using the [D&D 5e API](http://www.dnd5eapi.co/) and [Poké API](https://pokeapi.co/). Users can click the "Start!" button to initiate a battle before clicking either the "Attack!" or "Fight!" buttons to advance through each character's subsequent turns in combat. 

Once battle concludes, the all-time scoreboard is updated at the top of the page, and users are prompted to start a new battle. Upon clicking the "Again?" button, two new combatants are generated and the cycle begins anew.
